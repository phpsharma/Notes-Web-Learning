What is Cloud?

You can think of the cloud as coherent, large-scale, publicly accessible collection of compute, storage, and networking resources.

These are allocated via web service calls(A programmable interface accessed via HTTP requests), and are available for short- or long-term use in exchange for payment based on actual actual resources consumed.
