 Thursday 10 March 2016
[4:44:20 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: Sharma, don’t forget to remove the follow us on pinterest button when you put that pin it button
[4:44:21 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: thanks
[4:44:35 PM] sharma chelluri: sure sir!
[6:07:08 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: Sharma, we might want to make the image slightly bigger.. So once you implement it, don’t clear the cache, clear it only for one url ..
[6:07:23 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: I have asked Arjun to give us a bigger version of the image .. So you can try with that as well..
[6:07:37 PM] sharma chelluri: for pin it?
[6:07:41 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: yes
[6:07:52 PM] sharma chelluri: ask him to send it in png version
[6:08:07 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: sure..
[6:09:27 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: you can finish it before that.. just make sure that if we change the size of the bottom it won’t affect the design. Basically when you are placing it using css, use padding/margin right and bottom or something, so that the image size won’t matter the design and we can test with different versions without worrying about chaiinging the css..
[6:10:26 PM] sharma chelluri: it will affect the design as the size increases..
[6:10:36 PM] sharma chelluri: need to adjust css properties based on the image
[6:11:12 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: no, its possible to do it.. something like put an absolute and adjust it in relation to right and bottom .. then the size won’t matter..
[6:11:20 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: it will be placed correctly
[6:12:20 PM] sharma chelluri: ok
[6:13:00 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: Sharma, one more quick thing, the wp-api plugin is json-api and json-rest-api plugins right?
[6:13:08 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: we want to enable them in TBB as well..
[6:14:00 PM] sharma chelluri: I think they are already in admin.
[6:14:19 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: for TBB.. ok let me check it once..
[6:14:51 PM] sharma chelluri: can you forward the momjunction calculator request. the thing that ashok working on..
[6:15:34 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: done

[1:17:56 PM] sharma chelluri: cool..
[1:18:15 PM] Anush Prem.Incnut: and mail takes more time to get noticed and people tend to replay slower (or on a later point of time), thats why they send message for small things which they need to know asap.
